# Elbow calibration example

This contains the webapp part of the elbow calibration demo shown at the Zukunftskongress 2017 in Bonn.

The backend performing the actual calculation is not included here at the moment.

The script replay.md can be used to feed some recorded data to the webapp. Note that most buttons won't have any effect.
